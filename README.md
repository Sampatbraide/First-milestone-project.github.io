# UX
This website is for me, being one of the students of code institute, as I intend to showcase and develop some skills as a side hustle before venturing into it full time as I gain more experience in the software industry.
To seek more business and recognition, I ought to gain an online presence and the only solution is to provide this website for the public to get to know to know what type of service I can render.
once this website has been completed and published online it will enhance my company's online presence by providing web-based solutions to potential customers and clients.


# Features

# Home Page
This Section is considered as the landing page, once a customer types in the website, the customer lands on the index page which is the home page. This informs the customer what the website is all about.


# Our Services
This section informs the customers about the services we offer. As laid out on the page.


# Contact Us
This section is for those who visit on our website and are interested in our services.

# Future Improvements
The website will be password enabled so that only registered users could access the website.

I will create an inbuilt chat tool for instant response to customers for their queries and enquiries.
Contact Us
This section is for those who visit on our website and are interested in our services.

And after logging in, if the site is left inactive for more than 20mins  the site will automatically log off due to inactivity.

The website works well however, I need to still study more of the grid system in bootstrap to input it effectively in my website for accurate responsiveness.


# The Technologies I have used

HTML W3Schools,  for researching the correct  html syntax

CSS W3Schools for researching for correct  CSS syntax


# Icons Font Awesome 
Used in the project via downloads
Font Google fonts from google developers imbedded into my project
  

# Validators
I used HTML and CSS to validate the web document. 
When examing the web content with the HTML and CSS Validator, It displayed some errors in general, I then took a thorough look and corrected the errors.

I used Bootstrap to examine the website responsiveness


# Testing
Being a customer I would be glad to visit to a landing page that is simple and easy to navigate.

Being a customer,  I will like to see the company name at either the header or footer, so  I could check its authenticity at the company house before carrying out any business activities.

Being a customer  I will like to see a contact form where I could communicate with the company via emails or messages.

As a businessman, I ought to provide links to my social media account, so that clients can see the positive review and the companies community on social media.

As a businessman, I will list out the services I carry out on our Services Section so that the customers can know what to expect from such a business.

More so on the website, our logo is written to show our brand name.


# Manual Testing

# Home Page
This is the Index page, the landing page, once the domain name is typed in it instantly, brings you to this page, where you could click on the available pictures and preview it on a different page. Also from here you can navigate to other sections which is the about us or contact us page when hovering over these pages the background colour displays in grey with a blue line. 

# Our Services Section
From the home page navigate to the About us section, click on the images, link to the domain which also opens on a separate page as well as the social media pages. The links to different pages are visible to the right on the navbar. With the varied types of services, we provide carefully placed in four different columns.
 
# Contact Us Section
From the home page and Our services page, one can easily navigate to the contact form, input details and submit it. The summit button when hovered across displays in green.

# Header Section
It contains the names of different sections of the pages,  navbars, a welcome note. and the Logo name, all boldly written out.

# Footer  Section 
To confirm social media icons are working at the footer click on the various icons to see its functions. It contains the name of the company and the designer of the website.

The website is working well and I am still studying the grid system to input it effectively on my website for accurate responsiveness.

# Bugs
I noticed that everything works well but times when the page load the words tend to shift to the right-hand side.  

# Deployment
Deploying the GitHub Pages from my Desktop
Log into GitHub.
Find a repository that I have previously created
such as Sampatbraide/First-milestone-project.github.io
and then upload my project to the repository.
this will take a couple of minutes.
Once the process is completed I can examine it a re-test by ensuring that everything is working as expected.

from git hub  to the repository in the HTTP  section select clone access the Git Bash
input git clone by pasting the URL.
